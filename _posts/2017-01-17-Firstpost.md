title: First Week at Metis
---

Our first week at Metis ended with our first group project/presentation.  I didn't expect to do a group project in the first week, but I guess there's no better way to learn than to be throw into the deep end.

**The Project**   
We looked at MTA turnstile data to determine which subway stations were the optimal locations for canvassing for raising awareness and funding for a gala held by a nonprofit organization for women in tech.

As a group, we had to come to a consensus about what our assumptions are for this project and what methodology we would take.  We decided to combine entries and exits for combined daily traffic in the months of April, May and June since the gala was intended for early summer. We compared daily average traffic for each station narrowed down the list of stations to the 70th to 90th percentile of the population.  Then we combined this list with income data by subway station to prioritize areas with higher incomes.

The presentation, code and data used can be seen [here](https://github.com/Lisa622/proj1-mta).

**What I learned**  
I had forgotten what it was like to work in a group again.  Fleshing out ideas, agreeing on every approach.  I was definitely glad the first project was a group project, because there was no way I'd be able to do this in five days on my own.  

Aside from working in a group, I learned I had to think about things in different ways.  One group decided to use a ratio of entries to exits to categorize stations by how touristy they were.  I thought that was pretty clever.  It goes to show that data can be straightforward, but can be used differently to infer other things if you think outside of the box.  I need to remember this.

**In Other News**  
I chatted with my friend, Michele, about my first week.  She works in adtech out in Los Angeles and had originally pivoted her career in television production by doing a bootcamp for developers.  I was venting to her about how the program was much more intense than I had imagined, and I was feeling very ill-prepared. She reminded me that imposter syndrome is very real and much more prevalent amongst women. I remember chatting with a handful of the women in my cohort and how we were relieved to see more women in the class than expected, and that we were all feeling like we were in over our heads.  

I'm glad programs like Metis offer scholarsihps to women.  I'm also glad for [Project Include](http://projectinclude.org), Grace Hopper, and Women Who Code.  Maybe one day I'll be in a position to encourage more girls to get into STEM-related fields; and maybe those girls won't be surprised by the number of other girls in their classes.
